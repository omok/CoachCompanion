## Implementation Recommendations

1. **User Feedback Loops**: Establish regular feedback sessions with actual coaches after each phase to validate feature usefulness and gather insights that might adjust priorities for upcoming development phases.

2. **Technical Debt Management**: Schedule dedicated technical improvement sprints between major phases to refactor code, improve performance, and ensure the application maintains high quality as complexity increases.

3. **Incremental Deployment**: Deploy completed features as they become available rather than waiting for entire phases to be complete, allowing users to benefit from improvements as soon as possible.

4. **Feature Flags**: Implement a comprehensive feature flag system that allows enabling or disabling functionality in production, facilitating beta testing with select users before full rollout.

5. **Metrics Collection**: Define and implement usage analytics from the beginning to understand feature adoption, identify pain points, and quantify the impact of new capabilities on user engagement.

6. **Database Evolution**: Carefully plan for database schema evolution with migration strategies that preserve data integrity while accommodating the expanding data model required by advanced features. The current schema already includes good audit tracking with lastUpdatedByUser fields for all entities.
