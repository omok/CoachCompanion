- **Basic Payment Tracking**: Recording payments from players, including amount, date, and notes, with basic payment totals by player.
  
- **Team Member Management**: Managing team members with different roles (Owner, AssistantCoach, TeamManager, Regular) and appropriate permissions for each role.
  
- **User Profile Management**: Basic user profile management including name, username, and password updates.
  
- **Permission System**: Comprehensive permission control system based on user roles and team membership, implementing role-based access throughout the application.

## Phase 1: Core Experience Enhancement (1-2 Months)

Focus on improving already implemented features to create a solid foundation:

- **Enhanced Player Management**: Expand player profiles to include additional information such as positions played and emergency contacts (jersey number is already implemented), with better visualization of player information in the roster view.
  
- **Improved Practice Management**: Add practice categorization options (skills, scrimmage, conditioning), structured templates, and better organization of practice notes for easier tracking of team development over time.
  
- **Advanced Attendance Analytics**: Enhance the current attendance tracking with visual trends, automatic flagging of attendance issues, and customizable period-based attendance reports for better insights into team participation patterns.
  
- **Refined Payment System**: Expand the current payment tracking with period-based financial reports, outstanding balance calculations, and payment due notifications to improve financial management for coaches.
  
- **Mobile Responsiveness Optimization**: Further optimize the already mobile-friendly interface with special attention to court-side functionality like attendance taking and practice management during active sessions.

## Phase 2: Team Operations Essentials (2-3 Months)

Features that streamline day-to-day operations without external dependencies:

- **Scheduling & Calendar Management**: Implement a comprehensive calendar interface with drag-and-drop scheduling, recurring practice setup, and conflict detection to simplify complex scheduling requirements for busy coaching programs.
  
- **Communication System**: Develop team announcement boards, direct messaging between coaches and parents, and automated notification systems for practice changes, game reminders, and other important updates.
  
- **Player Development Tracking**: Create frameworks for documenting player skills, recording periodic assessments, and visualizing improvement over time with customizable evaluation criteria tailored to different age groups and skill levels.
  
- **Document Management**: Build a secure repository for storing important forms, team policies, liability waivers, and practice plans with appropriate sharing permissions based on user roles.

## Phase 3: Advanced Coaching Tools (2-3 Months)

Features focused on enhancing the coaching experience:

- **Practice Planning & Execution**: Develop a comprehensive practice plan builder with timed segments, drill libraries, and printable practice plans that coaches can distribute to assistant coaches and players before sessions.
  
- **Game Planning & Basic Scouting**: Create tools for documenting opponent tendencies, developing game strategies, and tracking key matchups with simple interfaces for quick pregame and postgame notes.
  
- **Team Statistics**: Implement basic statistical tracking for both team and individual players, including game-by-game results, performance trends, and visual representations of important metrics for performance analysis.

## Phase 4: Administrative Expansion (2-3 Months)

Features focused on business management aspects:

- **Enhanced Financial Management**: Build comprehensive budget planning tools, expense categorization, financial forecasting, and detailed reporting to help coaches track the business aspects of their basketball programs.
  
- **Compliance & Regulatory Documentation**: Implement digital waiver collection, automated document expiration tracking, and compliance reporting tools that align with league and governing body requirements for youth sports programs.
  
- **Roster Management Enhancements**: Create advanced player grouping, position tracking, and depth chart visualization tools to help coaches organize their teams more effectively for practices and game situations.

## Phase 5: External Integration & Advanced Features (3-4 Months)

Features requiring third-party integrations or having ongoing costs:

- **Online Registration & Waivers**: Develop custom registration forms, secure electronic signature capture, and streamlined player onboarding workflows that integrate directly with team roster management for seamless player addition.
  
- **Payment Gateway Integration**: Implement secure connections to payment processors like Stripe or PayPal, enabling automated payment processing, subscription management for recurring fees, and detailed transaction reporting.
  
- **Calendar Integration**: Create bidirectional synchronization with popular calendar platforms, allowing practice and game schedules to appear in coaches' and parents' personal calendars with automatic updates when changes occur.

## Phase 6: Premium Features & Scaling (4-6 Months)

Advanced features that provide significant value but require substantial development:

- **Advanced Player Development Analytics**: Build sophisticated player evaluation tools with customizable metrics, development trend analysis, and comparative assessment features to track player growth against benchmarks and team averages.
  
- **Point-of-Sale & Inventory Management**: Implement systems for tracking equipment and merchandise inventory, processing sales transactions, and managing orders with barcode scanning capabilities for efficient inventory management.
  
- **Marketing & CRM**: Develop email marketing campaign tools, lead management for prospective players, and promotional content scheduling to help coaches grow their programs and maintain engagement with current participants.

## Phase 7: Enterprise & Premium Capabilities (Future Roadmap)

Features targeting larger operations:

- **Access Control & Facility Management**: Create advanced facility scheduling tools, court allocation systems, and equipment checkout tracking to help larger organizations manage their physical resources more efficiently.

- **Advanced Scouting & Video Analysis**: Develop sophisticated opponent scouting databases, video clip management systems, and integration with analytical tools to provide coaches with detailed insights for game preparation.

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **User Feedback Loops**: Establish regular feedback sessions with actual coaches after each phase to validate feature usefulness and gather insights that might adjust priorities for upcoming development phases.

2. **Technical Debt Management**: Schedule dedicated technical improvement sprints between major phases to refactor code, improve performance, and ensure the application maintains high quality as complexity increases.

3. **Incremental Deployment**: Deploy completed features as they become available rather than waiting for entire phases to be complete, allowing users to benefit from improvements as soon as possible.

4. **Feature Flags**: Implement a comprehensive feature flag system that allows enabling or disabling functionality in production, facilitating beta testing with select users before full rollout.

5. **Metrics Collection**: Define and implement usage analytics from the beginning to understand feature adoption, identify pain points, and quantify the impact of new capabilities on user engagement.

6. **Database Evolution**: Carefully plan for database schema evolution with migration strategies that preserve data integrity while accommodating the expanding data model required by advanced features. The current schema already includes good audit tracking with lastUpdatedByUser fields for all entities.
