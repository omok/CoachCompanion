# CoachCompanion Best Practices

This document summarizes the best practices observed in the CoachCompanion codebase that should be followed in all future development.

## Architecture Best Practices

1. **Clean Separation of Concerns**
   - Frontend and backend code are clearly separated
   - Shared types maintain consistency across the stack
   - Business logic is separated from UI components

2. **TypeScript Throughout**
   - Leveraging TypeScript for both frontend and backend ensures type safety
   - Shared schema types prevent inconsistencies between client and server
   - Types are exported cleanly at the bottom of schema files

3. **Modular API Design**
   - API endpoints are grouped by resource and organized in separate files
   - Routes follow RESTful principles
   - Route handlers are clean and focused on a single responsibility

## Frontend Best Practices

1. **Component Structure**
   - Components are named clearly with a `{feature}-{type}.tsx` convention
   - UI components are imported from a common design system
   - Components have clear responsibilities and manageable size

2. **Data Fetching with React Query**
   - Centralized query client configuration
   - Consistent pattern for queries and mutations
   - Proper error handling and loading states
   - Query invalidation for keeping data fresh

3. **Form Handling**
   - Consistent use of React Hook Form
   - Zod validation schemas shared with the backend
   - Clear error display for users

4. **Error Handling**
   - Proper loading states during async operations
   - Toast notifications for user feedback
   - Consistent pattern for API error handling

5. **Logging**
   - Consistent logging pattern for debugging:
   ```typescript
   const logEvent = (component: string, action: string, data?: any) => {
     const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
     console.log(`[${timestamp}] [${component}] ${action}`, data ? data : '');
   };
   ```

6. **Authentication Context**
   - Authentication state is managed in a centralized context
   - Login and logout operations are exposed through mutations
   - User role information is available throughout the app

## Backend Best Practices

1. **Storage Interface Pattern**
   - Database operations are abstracted behind a clean interface
   - Consistent error handling for database operations
   - Parameterized queries for security
   - Clear separation of database logic from route handlers

2. **Authentication Implementation**
   - Session-based authentication with secure cookies
   - Password hashing with scrypt and salts
   - CSRF protection for enhanced security
   - Role-based authorization checks

3. **Error Handling**
   - Consistent error responses with appropriate status codes
   - Different error details in development vs production
   - Proper logging of errors

4. **Input Validation**
   - All user input is validated using Zod schemas
   - Validation schemas are shared with the frontend
   - Type conversion is handled securely

## Data Modeling Best Practices

1. **Schema Design**
   - Clear entity relationships
   - Proper foreign key relationships
   - Consistent naming conventions
   - Boolean flags for toggleable state (e.g., active players)

2. **Validation Schemas**
   - Zod schemas for all database entities
   - Type transformations handled in the schema
   - Required vs optional fields clearly defined

## Testing Best Practices

1. **Test Organization**
   - Tests located in a separate `test/` directory
   - Clear naming convention for test files
   - Tests for both frontend and backend components

2. **Test Coverage**
   - Tests for happy paths and error scenarios
   - Mock dependencies for isolated testing
   - UI component testing with testing-library

## Security Best Practices

1. **Authentication Security**
   - Secure password storage with proper hashing algorithm
   - Session management with secure cookies
   - CSRF protection via double submit cookie pattern using csrf-csrf
   - Token refreshing for invalid CSRF tokens

2. **Authorization Checks**
   - Role-based access control (coach vs parent)
   - Server-side verification for all protected operations
   - Consistent checking of resource ownership

3. **Input Handling**
   - Validation of all user input
   - Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
   - Sanitization of user-generated content

## Performance Best Practices

1. **Query Optimization**
   - Proper React Query configuration for caching
   - Strategic query invalidation
   - Memoization of expensive calculations

2. **UI Rendering**
   - Avoiding unnecessary re-renders
   - Using useMemo and useCallback appropriately
   - Optimizing list rendering

## Development Workflow Best Practices

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Using .env for environment variables
   - Different configurations for development and production
   - Secure handling of secrets

2. **Error Logging**
   - Structured logging with timestamps and component names
   - Different verbosity in development vs production
   - Focusing on actionable information

These best practices have been extracted from the CoachCompanion codebase and should be followed to maintain code quality and consistency when making future enhancements.
